String to Number
--------------
Apple to 3
so now array [0,0,0,0.5,0]
0.5 IS the price of apple stored at 3rd index
--------------
Milk to 0
so now array [1.7,0,0,0.5,0]
1.7 IS the price of milk stored at 0th index


Now we can get price by say name only (milk)
then get price of 0th index

In python 
dict() implement hashtable
In Js
book["apple"]=0.2


HASH TABLE INSIDE
